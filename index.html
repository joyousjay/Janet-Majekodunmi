<!--Hello, maker! Welcome to my Electrate Fuego web design tutorial. I'm glad you found it – for this might be a real intersection on your way to becoming. I (S.J. Quigley) use this document in my Technical Communications classes at the University of Pittsburgh to teach my students a little bit about computer science and something called "electracy." Just follow along with comments like this one, and you'll make a really cool web documemt that not only introduces you to the other people in our classes, but will help you process how different discourse communities in your life have contributed to your arrival in this space, virtual and actual, and also contribute to where you might be going. 

In this doc, you will work through Gregory Ulmer's discourses of career, family, entertainment, community, and schooling (_Internet Invention From Literacy to Electracy_, 2002.) In Ulmer's text, he elides community and schooling into one category, but for our puposes I have separated them. Ulmer's theory of electracy helps makes sense of how we find/construct meaning and connect with others rhetorically in a media rich ecology. Ulmer uses analogy to define electracy, explaining that "electracy is to digital media what literacy is to print." 

You could make this document the easy way by posting on Google Site, an Adobe Spark, a Weebly, or a Wix--or you can do a little more work to unconceal, opening up these tools that you use every day, but might not know how they function, yet prove so necessary to how you (re)present yourself and connect with others in virtual spaces. And this last bit is an important point! If we really want to be makers, if we really want to be creative, then we need to understand what our digital tools do, how they work, and consider the implications of their use. Through this process you will alos learn a little bit about computer literacy and computer science. Enough to allow you to build web texts and understand file management. 

So let's cut this thing open – using "tmesis" as the Ancient Greeks would call it – lets "cut" and arrange, tweak, take away and augment...that's how we create! I hope you're excited to use this tool to create a document that will simultaneously help you process your journey and help orient you along the path on which you are headed in your becoming. Before we get going I would like to give a shout-out to my research buddy Shauna Chung, who helped me develop the original Ulmerian framework we will be following in this document. Are you ready to get started?--> 
    
 <!--To get started, you will need to fork my repository from GitHub if you haven't already. If you want to easily publish it on GitHub, I'll give you more information at the end of this document. But for right now, fork, and then download the website to a zip file (or clone it, if you know what that means). Go ahead and put these files in a secure place (folder) where you will be able to find them and organize your other assests like images, pdfs, etcetera. You will also need a text editor like "brackets.io" or "atom.io" or "notepad-plus-plus.org." Open the style.css and index.html documents in the text editor and we can get started building our own electrate experience.--> 

<!--BTW. You can leave these hidden HTML text fields be, or delete them. They are but road signs, absent from the larger design-->

<!--First we will need to do some work in the head of the document. The head organizes important information needed to expalin to browsers how the website will work. Go ahead and change the title of this HTML document below, from "Electrate Fuego" to whatever you want it to be called. Your new text will appear in your browser tab-->
    
<title>Janet Majekodunmi :) </title> 
    
    <!--this next section of code does important work to help different browsers understand what this page should look like on the different kinds of screens.--> 
    
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
    
     <!--this code tells the browser to link to the style.css file that controls the appearance of much of your content.--> 
    
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">
</head>
  
  
<!--The body of the document houses the content that a user usually sees on a website. We'll be spending most of our time in this section.-->
    
<body>
       
<!-- We'll need to do some more work in this section, but to do so, we'll need to make some changes on your style.css file. Developers refer to this division as a "Hero Block," but we will refer to it as a "Wide Image."  Think carefully about the image you select and how it might serve a sybolic function in your life. Ulmer refers to these kinds of symbolic images as "wide images" in that they often repeat over and over in our lifetime. We will similarly repeat this image at the end of your Electrate Infuego composition to establish a motif in this web document.  

Place a .jpg or .png in the same file folder as this project (hint: simplify the name). You don't need to do anything on this html page, but you'll need to change the background image name on the style.css page to match you image asset.

Now, change the other relevant information in this section, especially if you're not John en Fuego or not majoring in "electracy"-->

      <!--In our first exploration of discourse, we're going to think about the wider characteristics or themes of our field or future career. In academia, we do a lot of work narrowing our interest to arrive at a career or profession, often reducing our field to a level of operation or an act. Instead, I would like you to think more broadly about the "wider themes" you associate with your field or future career and its larger significance in improving our world. Yes--improving the world. Thinking back, where do you see exposure to those same "wider themes" in your own life? Those ah-ha moments, lessons, examples, tools, passions, or qualities that suggested this career path to you? Replace the content between <h2> and </h2> that begins with "Lorem ipsum."-->

  <h2>I am interested in pursuing a career in the entertainment technology industry as a software graphics engineer or as a technical artist.
    In this field, I would like to help build software pipelines or platforms that help enable more representation among minorities in the media and in the big

<!--We will begin this section with a photo grid. Add those beautiful, meaningful "family" and "home" photos (only you can define family) to your project folder, making sure the files end in .jpg or .png and replace/add the names of your assets to the grid below. You can add more photos if you wish, or subtract... see what happens – you have to be playful to find the purpose of things. You may need to adjust the size of your assets to produce the effect you desire. Resizing local files is one way to control the size of images on a website.-->

  <h2>To me family is a close community that confide, love, and depend on one another regardless of the circumstances. My family is one of my biggest support systems and a huge motivation for me. Each person shown here has made sacrifices or helped me in one way or another to get me where I am today.
    I would say family is not always blood-related, but they treat you as if you are. It is a type of community that was force to become family but ended up choosing become family. 
    They overlook flaws and accept them for who they are. My family and my non-biological aunt (pictured bottom right) has always provided constant support and care towards me. They helped and guided me through making 
  life decisions, have been there in times of need, and add to my joy. Home is not just a location, it is the people that make me consider Prince George's County, Maryland my home. The community I grew up always encouraged me to want the best for myself and instilled in a desire to be sucessful. It has helped me determine to put in my best efforts in every environment I am in.</h2>

<!--Now we are moving into the kinds of media that contributes to your everyday discourse. This might sound weird, but Ulmer argues that media has actually contributed a great deal to who you are as a person, how you language yourself, and even how you move through the world and interact with others. So, let's take some time to explore this discourse area. You have the opportunity to add video content or other significant media content. You might also add images to this section (see the bottom of this sheet for directions on how to add elements) perhaps adding a photo grid like the one you did for the "Family" section. Experiment. You can't break this thing, right? Control Z. Control Z. Control Z... -->

<!--Time to process. How do you use media? What role do certain kinds of media play in your life? How does media serve a social function? In what way might you be "recreating" or "remaking" media in your everyday life? 

FUN FACT: "Lorem ipsum", "Lorem ipsum" was hacked out of Cicero's "De finibus bonorum et malorum," developers made it non-sensical. So while you will probably never write as well as Cicero, you can always improve upon "Lorem ipsum." -->  
    
  <h2>Media plays a major role as a form of entertainment. I use social media to connect with friends and family and as place to laugh, I watch movies and television shows to relax, and I listen to music to relieve stress and as a pasttime hobby in addition to singing. Media also acts as an educational tool to teach me new topics or skills or inform me of what is happening nationally and globally. Media acts as a form of communication between the listener and the speaker and the actor and the viewer. It provides a voice for those that are usually unheard and it delivers a message to various groups of people. Without media, I think it would result in there being miscommunication. One of my favorite artists Lauryn Hill said "miscommunication leads to complication" and without the media perfoming its role as a communicator, many advancements and progress would not be reached in society. I believe I recreate media whenever I indulge in graphic design or when I sing. I also think making connections is another way I remake media in my everyday life. </h2>

 <!--So what exactly is your community: is it actual? virtual? Where do find your ground, or at least, where do you drop anchor, you drifter, you? While we often think of communities as neighborhoods and clubs and a group of colleagues or friends, you might find community across the frontiers of the dead, and perhaps even with those who have never lived. I'll let you explain. -->  
 <h2> My community is made up of multiple independent groups from different places that are created through a bond or interest. Some of the communities I am in are with people of the same belief, morals, major, hobbies, hometown, and ethnicity. I am apart of real communities, an example being the collage pictured below which are some of my friends I made through attending the same high school, church, and college. The other communities, which are mainly professional, are virtual and made up of women in computing and STEM that have the same passion to interest the representation among women in the tech industry. I have not met majority of them in person, yet the support they show and resources they provide make us a close knit community. 
   I find my ground with people who are of similar yet different mindsets than me yet push and challenge me to grow in different areas of life.   </h2>

  <h2>When I was applying for colleges, I never thought I would end up at Pitt. When my dream school waitlisted me, I began to look at my other options and ended up picking Pitt. I do not regret my decision to come to Pitt, in fact I'm grateful and blessed that I did not end up going to NCSU for college. Pitt has provided me many opportunities academically, allowed me to meet some amazing people, and have received tremendeous support from faculty and toher students. I am able to flourish and grow as a person and individual because of the environment here at Pitt. While I am only a junior and still have many more experiences left before I graduate, I am looking forward to the unexpected and continually trying new things. </h2>
